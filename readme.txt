Check a Domain WHOIS Lookup for availability. Simple insert the [pwhois] shortcode on a page or post

== Description ==
Checks Domain WHOIS Lookup for availability. Simple insert the [pwhois] shortcode on a page or post. 
To select the default TLD use the default attribute: [pwhois default=com] - sets .com as default in the TLD dropdown.
TLD List is limited because of the knowledge of the required whois servers. If you wish to have support for a special TLD please contact me and I will implement it asap.
We cannot guarantee that every domain lookup works perfect, in case that whois servers and how to talk to them can change time by time. 
However if you inform us about changes and we can get it to work, we give you a free version of the Pro version of this plugin!
